finitescroll
============

Jquery (in)finite scroll plugin.
Very, very simple plugin, because I don't like existing jQuery infinite scroll plugins for various reasons.
This plugin just takes an url and put the requested content at the end of the selected block.

How to use
----------

As this is a jQuery plugin, it depends on jQuery to run, so include it.

You can then use it by calling:

    $("your-selector").finitescroll({
        url: function(page) {
            return "?page="+page;
        }
    });

...where the url option is a callback that takes the current page and returns the url associated with the corresponding resource.
The plugin will append the content of the response at the end of the specified selector whenever you scroll to the bottom of it.
